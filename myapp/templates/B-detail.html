                    <h3>Tim Ferriss podcast with Arnold Schwarzenegger highlights</h3>

                    <p class="blog-para mb-2 mt-4">In Tim Ferriss' most recent podcast he had on the famous Arnold
                        Schwarzenegger as his guest. Arnold went out of his way to discuss how important to him
                        afterschool programs for kids are. He highlighted chess specifically as one that he would
                        love to promote because of how much it can benefit the youth. Here is one small excerpt
                        where he mentions his passion for these things through love for the movie Brooklyn Castle.
                    </p>

                    <p class="blog-para mb-2">"Like for instance, Brooklyn Castle. If someone would have come to me
                        and said, “Hey, here’s a documentary we want to do about after school programs and inner
                        city kids”, I’d say, “Wait a minute, those are two things I’m very passionate about.” I love
                        playing chess, which is what it’s all about, right, the documentary. How kids in the inner
                        cities play chess and how they become smart and how they stay off the streets and therefore
                        not get into trouble with teenage pregnancy and get into juvenile crime and all those
                        things. They have adult supervision and they get confidence. Those are kids that 70% of them
                        are below the poverty line. So that’s a great story and it is something that both of them,
                        chess and inner city kids and after school programs, I feel passionate about. So I would
                        have put money into that. And I wouldn’t have been in it. I would have done it because I
                        think it’s a story that ought to be told."
